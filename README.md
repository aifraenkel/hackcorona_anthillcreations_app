At the momento, it is a Facebook Messenger Chatbot. The architecture is ready to scale to most used social networks, including WhatsApp. The demostration is implemented for latin america, spanish language.

## MVP - Design Decisions - a.k.a. Why?
- We choose python for the models api, because python was the most suitable language to do an experiment of risk calculation model, and it also simplifies the evolution  of that model to a Machine Learning model. 
- We priorize productivity and time to market, instead of priorizing code quality and coverage because the whole MVP was developed in a two days hackathon.
- Chatbot was developed using DialogFlow, because that platform is good enough for scale the bot and have lot of options of integration.
- To simplify costs management, and because it was natural too, we use GCP for every component.
